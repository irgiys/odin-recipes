      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
         <li>2 potatoes</li>
         <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
         <li>1 egg</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Direction</h2>
      <h3>Step 1</h3>
      <p>
         Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Peel potatoes and add to pot. Cook until tender but still firm,
         about 15 minutes. Drain, cool and mash with a fork or potato masher.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 2</h3>
      <p>
         Combine 1 cup mashed potato, flour and egg in a large bowl. Knead until dough forms a ball. Shape small
         portions of the dough into long "snakes". On a floured surface, cut snakes into half-inch pieces.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 3</h3>
      <p>
         Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Drop in gnocchi and cook for 3 to 5 minutes or until
         gnocchi have risen to the top; drain and serve.
