      <h1>Perfect Summer Fruit Salad</h1>
      <h4>
         The perfect fruit salad for a backyard bbq or any occasion. There are never leftovers! This is one of my
         favorite fruit salad recipes, as I think the sauce really makes it. This salad is tastier the longer you can
         let it soak in its juices. I prefer 3 to 4 hours in the refrigerator before I serve it. Enjoy.

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
         <li>⅔ cup fresh orange juice</li>
         <li>⅓ cup fresh lemon juice</li>
         <li>⅓ cup packed brown sugar</li>
         <li>½ teaspoon grated orange zest</li>
         <li>½ teaspoon grated lemon zest</li>
         <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
         <li>2 cups cubed fresh pineapple</li>
         <li>2 cups strawberries, hulled and sliced</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Direction</h2>
      <h3>Step 1</h3>
      <p>
         Bring orange juice, lemon juice, brown sugar, orange zest, and lemon zest to a boil in a saucepan over
         medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Remove from
         heat, and stir in vanilla extract. Set aside to cool.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 2</h3>
      <p>
         Layer the fruit in a large, clear glass bowl in this order: pineapple, strawberries, kiwi fruit, bananas,
         oranges, grapes, and blueberries. Pour the cooled sauce over the fruit. Cover and refrigerate for 3 to 4 hours
         before serving.
